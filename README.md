# CSE180-Intro_To_Robotics-Final_Project

This project was created using ROS Kinetic with C++. The objective of this project was to be able make a robot search and log objects that are in a obstacle enviroment. Appliying all that was learned through this class made this project more of an problem solving engineering project instead of just learning how syntax works.

Throughout this class I learned how to:
  Create topic broadcasters and listeners
  Control position and velocity data
  Used Ultrasonic Sensors
  Used Laser Sensors
  Learned how different components of ros work in parallel
