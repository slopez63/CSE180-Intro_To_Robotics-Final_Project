# CSE180-Intro_To_Robotics-Final_Project

This project was created using ROS Kinetic with C++. The objective of this project was to be able make a robot search and log objects that are in a obstacle enviroment. Appliying all that was learned through this class made this project more of an problem solving engineering project instead of just learning how syntax works.

Throughout this class I learned how to: 
  Create topic broadcasters and listeners,
  larned how to use standard messages such as position and velocity data,
  used Ultrasonic Sensors,
  used Laser Sensors,
  used different robot localisation tools such as Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization and Extended Kalman Filter,
  learned how different components of ros work in parallel.
