# CSE180-Intro_To_Robotics-Final_Project

This project was created using ROS Kinetic in C++. The objective of this project was to be able make a robot search and log objects that are in a obstacle enviroment. Appliying all that was learned through this class made this project more of an problem solving engineering project instead of just learning how syntax works.

Throughout this class I learned how to 
  create topic broadcasters and listeners,
  use standard messages such as position and velocity data,
  use Ultrasonic Sensors,
  use Laser Sensors,
  use different robot localisation tools such as Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization and Extended Kalman Filter,
  build different ros nodes in parallel.
